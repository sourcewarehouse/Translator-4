ABOUT
 This is a translator from Java to C++.
 The translator produces correct C++ for the provided 39 Java test files.
 This translator was built on top of the given XTC software package.
  More information about XTC here: http://cs.nyu.edu/xtc/

 The translatorâ€™s source code is located in: Translator/xtc/src/cpptranslator 

************************************************************************

RUNNING THE TRANSLATOR:

1. Configure XTC for your machine according 
   to the instructions here:
   http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/step-by-step.html

   Note that there is no need to install XTC separately. 
   This package is built on top of XTC, so it already
   includes XTC.

2. Go to directory Translator/xtc

3. Compile the translator:
 - . setup.sh
 - make

   The compiled translator files appear in: Translator/xtc/classes/cpptranslator

4. Run the translator to get the C++ code for the test files:
 - java cpptranslator/Translator classes/[filename]
   
   The test files are located in: Translator/xtc/classes
   
5. Compile the C++ code:
 - sh CompileRecentTest.sh 

   If .sh does not run:
   - g++ -std=c++11 main.cc (any Java classes) (test file name) java_lang.cc

	WHERE:
	 (any Java classes)
		is the series of .cc files of classes in the Java file.
		So if the Java test file has class A and class B,
		then this would be A.cc and B.cc; see list of printed .cc files
	
	 (test file name) 
		is the name of the test file.
		So if the Java test file is named Test001.java,
		then this would be Test001.cc; see list of printed .cc files

6. Run the compiled C++:
 - ./a.out
